1. Explore the documentation for five attributes of a series from Jupyter

I found these 5:
1. cov -> Compute covariance with Series, excluding missing values.
2. mean -> Compute mean with Series, excluding missing values.
3. drop -> Remove elements of a Series based on specifying the index labels
4. dot -> Compute the dot product between the Series and the columns of other.
5. fillna -> Deprecated since version 2.1.0: Use ffill or bfill instead.





2. How many attributes are found on the .str attribute? Look at the documentation for three of them

I found these 3:
1. count -> Count occurrences of pattern in each string of the Series/Index
2. capitalize -> Convert strings in the Series/Index to be capitalized
3. strip -> Remove trailing characters




3. How many attributes are found on the .dt attribute? Look at the documentation for three of them

I found these 3:
1. date -> Returns numpy array of python datetime.date objects
2. time -> Returns numpy array of datetime.time objects
3. month -> The month as January=1, December=12.
